            <h2>Sultan Fateh Ali Sahab Tipu</h2>
            <p>Tipu Sultan, also known as the Tiger of Mysore, was born on November 20, 1750, in Devanahalli, near
                present-day Bangalore, India. He was the eldest son of Sultan Hyder Ali of Mysore, a powerful ruler in
                southern India. Tipu Sultan succeeded his father as the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore in 1782 after his
                death.<br>
                He is also a controversial figure, with
                opinions divided on his legacy, seen by some as a freedom fighter and by others as a ruthless dictator.
